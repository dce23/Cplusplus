PathSearch: In this program the Data Structure used to do so actual work is Queue(FIFO). The algorithm implemented with a queue is Breath First Search which will be used for seaching thru the maze. Using that approach, i check all the spots i'm 1 step away from. Then all the spots 2 steps away. Then Continuing to spot 3 and so on. I use this approach to guarantee that if i do find the end, there couldn't have been any shorther paths.
