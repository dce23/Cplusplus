Path Search

In this homework, we have an intrepid adventurer trying to find their lost dog in a maze. The program is going to find a path from their position to the dog.

The map class is ability to read in a text map file, store the information from the map and let you ask questions about it. Each map is a complete rectangle.

The questions you can ask are:
•	The width and height of the map
•	The position of the adventurer (the start position)
•	The position of the dog (the end position)
•	Whether a certain position is blocked or not

Positions in the map are specified by row and column, using the position class. Rows and columns are counted from 0, like we always do in code.
